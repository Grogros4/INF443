# Relativity Simulator

This repository contains all the C++, OpenGL and GLSS code developed for our research project in 3D graphics computer science. We modelized our school campus and built a simulator where the player can walk through the campus while modifying the speed of light and visualized the consequences. 

Furthermore, we designed our project with modularity in mind. Therefore, it is pretty easy for anyone to add features to this world and built a more complex game out of it. 

For more information, including the proof that our work is physically correct, please read our report attached in this repository.
